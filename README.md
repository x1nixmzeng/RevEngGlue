# RevEngGlue

Glue library written in C# to allow aid porting file format documentation into standalone tools.

Most of my file formats are reverse-engineered as Binary Templates (with [010 Editor][0]) so this library will aim to mimic these features. It also contains a version of [prelen.bt][1] to handle how strings are commonly stored in video game formats.

For general game format discussions visit [XeNTaX][2].
